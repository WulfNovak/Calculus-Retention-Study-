# Calculus Retention Study
In this repository we recreate a calculus retention study. This includes data cleaning, variable creation, data visualization, a mixed effects logistic regression model, and some very simple interactive graphs. 

**Where to start:** Under the following file description section I have the files listed in the order you should visit them.

**File Description:**
1. Original Calc Retention Study
  * This is the original study and writeup. The data used and tables created in the following files were found in this paper. Instructions from this paper were used to assure accurately clean the data, and a mixed-effects logistic regression model was created under the same specifications as the paper, however, the bayesian portion was not recreated.
